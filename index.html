				<p>
				When people leave their car unattended on a hot day, they often forget about what’s temperature sensitive, ranging from children and pets to groceries and medicine.  Further, if they do remember, they often do not know how long they can leave these things in the car before it is considered dangerous.

				<a href="files/personaSheet.pdf"><h2>Team Assignment: Personas for Temperature Alert System</h2></a>
				<p>
					This PDF is a four-page document detailing each of the personas created as examples of potential users for our temperature alert system application. Each page lists a variety of attributes for a single given persona, with each persona having been constructed by a separate team member. Together, they represent a spread of different users, each with different lifestyles and personalities that influence how they will use our application.

			<section class="assignment-details">
				<a href="files/storyBoard.pdf"><h2>Team Assignment: Story Board</h2></a>
				<p>
					This PDF is a document that combines four storyboards based on the personas created in the previous assignment. Each storyboard takes a different persona and demonstrates a certain situation relevant to that persona that involves the usage of our application. The idea is to demonstrate a diverse selection of uses for our application that involves a wide spread of potential users, reflected in the diversity of our personas.

				<a href="files/sketch.pdf"><h2>Team Assignment: Sketching</h2></a>
				<p>
					This PDF is a comprehensive document that combines multiple sketched out concepts for potential app designs that integrate our proposed temperature monitoring system. Each group member put forward three designs, with each design possessing a certain number of screens that assist the functionality of the solution. A majority of the included designs have three internal screens, while one set of designs has four internal screens per design. Each design is intended to demonstrate a different method of implementing the temperature monitoring system as a functioning app for end users.

				<p>
					This PDF is list of three tasks issued to two example users interacting with the paper prototype under the guise of the proposed “Scenario” at the top of the PDF, which is intended to shape their actions and rationalize the details of each task from an end user perspective. The “Notes” section details changes that can be made to the prototype in response to positive and negative interaction feedback from the users who attempted the three tasks.
